# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Project

## Description:
Welcome to the repository for my Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Project! In this project, I utilized machine learning models to forecast AQI based on historical air quality data. The dataset includes various air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, CO, SO2, and additional parameters like Benzene, Toluene, and Xylene. The project aligns with the strategic goal of promoting environmental sustainability and public health by providing insights for informed decision-making in air quality management.

## Key Features:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with statistical summaries, heatmap generation, and visualizations.
- Data preprocessing, including handling null values and encoding categorical variables.
- Implementation of machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree.
- Model training, testing, and evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
- Correlation analysis and visualization for a better understanding of data relationships.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file to explore the step-by-step process and code implementation.
3. Run the notebook to reproduce the results and visualize the AQI predictions.

## Skills Demonstrated:
- Data Analysis
- Machine Learning
- Data Visualization
- Python Programming
- Model Evaluation
- Environmental Analytics

## Outcome:
This project resulted in a reliable model for AQI prediction, contributing to the broader field of environmental data science. Feel free to explore the code and documentation to gain insights into the process.
